### What I learned

Another fun project to pratice javascript along with Api. Working with this particular Api was quite challenging based on the fact that it is not a static url. Making fetch request based on each state such as search by name, filter by region etc really helped me to thinking differently while working with the api. Also error handling is one of the major aspect that i have some issues with. At the end of all, I was really put in my best to replicate the design as close as possible with the various functionalities implementation as well.
